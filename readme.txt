Note that, in HelloWorldImpl.java, when it says:

@WebService(endpointInterface = "myHelloWorld.HelloWorld")

What it is telling you is which package (myHellOWorld) and which
interface (HelloWorld)  contains the interface that the
HelloWorldImpl class connects to

"A service endpoint interface or service endpoint implementation (SEI) is a Java interface or class, 
respectively, that declares the methods that a client can invoke on the service. An interface is 
not required when building a JAX-WS endpoint. The web service implementation class implicitly defines
 an SEI.

You may specify an explicit interface by adding the endpointInterface element to the @WebService annotation 
in the implementation class. You must then provide an interface that defines the public methods made 
available in the endpoint implementation class."
